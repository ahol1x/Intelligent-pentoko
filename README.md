The primary goal of our program is to create a game of five-in-a-row chess that provides individuals with a relaxing way to play chess, even if they do not have a partner. This will be achieved through the use of multiple gameplay modes

Our program's functionality includes the ability to detect a player's move on the chessboard and respond with a computer move to determine the game's progress if one of the player has achieved the winning criterion of victory, five in a row. Additionally, our program enables users to change game modes and players, providing a versatile and engaging chess experience.

Our program takes user input through left-clicks on various buttons and coordinates of the chessboard interface we have created. The program's output includes the chess piece`s image displayed upon clicking, a win or lose message, mode changes initiated through mode selection buttons, and the game's restart or end through dedicated buttons.
